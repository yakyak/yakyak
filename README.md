**NOTE**

Yakyak may show up as iOS Device and Google may alert you that *"some iOS Device is trying to use your account"*. This is normal as yakyak is an unofficial client and it mimics the behaviour of an iOS device in order to establish a communication with Google Hangout APIs.

## Developing

This is an open source project. Please help us!

It is written in coffeescript (nodejs) based on
[hangupsjs](https://github.com/algesten/hangupsjs) using
[trifl](http://algesten.github.io/trifl/) on top of
[electron (atom shell)](https://github.com/electron/electron).

### How can you help?

You can improve YakYak in many ways:

* Core functionality
* Interface *(example: new themes only require choosing less than 20 colors)*
* Bug fixing
* Translations *(new translation only need 117 strings)*

Send a pull request, start a conversation with a
[new issue](https://github.com/yakyak/yakyak/issues/new) or participate on a
 [ongoing conversation](https://github.com/yakyak/yakyak/issues).

### Setup

Requirements:

- Node.js (v4 or v6)

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run gulp
```

### Continuous build

```bash
$ npm run gulp watch
```

### Run it

```bash
$ npm run electron app
```

### Build Binaries for Deployment

*Supported platforms:* Windows (*win32*), Mac OS X (*darwin*), Linux (*linux*)

*Suported architectures:* 64-bits (*x64*), 32-bits (*ia32*)

```bash
# Building for all platforms and architectures
$ npm run deploy

# You can also build specific builds by using
#  deploy:<platform>-<architecture>
# example:
$ npm run deploy:darwin-x64
```

If you have [fpm](https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm) installed (`gem install fpm`), you can also build RPM and Deb packages:

```bash
$ npm run deploy:linux-x64:rpm
$ npm run deploy:linux-x64:deb
```

*note:* if you are building *Windows* binaries in *Linux* or *Mac OS X*, Wine (1.6 or higher) must be installed. It also requires a 32-bit Wine installation when building Windows 32-bit binary.

### Structure
